# WaterQuality

This project is made for the "Introduction to Data Science" subject as a mandatory project to finish the class successfully. Project number is D22.

**Team members:** <br>
>Artur Hendrik Mägi<br>
>Gregor Rämmal

**Data:**<br>
>Data is provided by Estonian government from a Kaggle competition "Drinking Water Quality Prediction" https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/copy-of-drinking-water-quality

**Project goals:** <br>
>**Goal 1:** Create different models that predict the water quality in Estonian water stations based on the government’s open data of the previous measurements. Find the best approach from those. <br>
>**Goal 2:** Analyze the differences between the models. <br>
>**Goal 3:** Find correlations between the features and the result.

**Files:** <br>
> File **"final.ipynb"** demonstrates how we sorted out the best features <br>
> File **"Projekt.ipynb"** is a draft of all our work
